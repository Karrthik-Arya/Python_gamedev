# Welcome to Week-3 of Learner's Space

This week we are going to learn to use Pygame, a collection of fun, powerful Python modules
that manage graphics, animation, and even sound, making it easier for you to build sophis-
ticated games. With Pygame handling tasks like drawing images to the screen, you can skip much of the
tedious, difficult coding and focus on the higher-level logic of game dynamics.

Making games is an ideal way to have fun while learning a language. It’s deeply satisfying to watch others play a game you wrote, and writing a simple game 
will help you understand how professional games are written.  

We will be making an Alien Invasing game while learning about various methods/functions of the pygame
module. Note the game will span a number of different files, so make a new folder called alien_invasion. Be sure to save all files for the game to this folder so *import* statements will work correctly.


## Setting up Pygame
Before we begin coding, we must install Pygame. Here’s how to do so on Linux, MacOS X, and Microsoft Windows:  
To install on Windows you can go through [this](https://www.youngwonks.com/blog/How-to-Install-PyGame-on-Windows) link.  
To install on Mac you can go through [this](https://www.youngwonks.com/blog/How-to-Install-PyGame-on-a-Mac) link.
### Installing Pygame on Linux
To install Pygame using the package manager.
Open a terminal window and run the following command, which will
download and install Pygame onto your system:  
```
$ sudo apt-get install python-pygame
```
If you are using pyhton 3 just replace `python-pygame` with `python3-pygame`.  
To make sure its been installed correctly open the python interpreter by runnning `python` or `python3` on the terminal depending on your version of python.
Then try running `import pygame`. If it runs without any error then pygame is successfully installed.
